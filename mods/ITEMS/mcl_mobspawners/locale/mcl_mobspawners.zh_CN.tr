Mob Spawner=刷怪笼
Makes mobs appear=使生物出现
A mob spawner regularily causes mobs to appear around it while a player is nearby. Some mob spawners are disabled while in light.=当玩家在附近时，刷怪笼会定期使其周围生成生物。有些刷怪笼在有光照的情况下会失效。
If you have a spawn egg, you can use it to change the mob to spawn. Just place the item on the mob spawner. Player-set mob spawners always spawn mobs regardless of the light level.=如果你有刷怪蛋，就可以用它来改变刷怪笼要生成的生物种类。只需将该物品放置在刷怪笼上就行。玩家设置过的刷怪笼无论光照等级如何，都会生成生物。
You need the “maphack” privilege to change the mob spawner.=你需要“地图透视”权限才能更改刷怪笼。
