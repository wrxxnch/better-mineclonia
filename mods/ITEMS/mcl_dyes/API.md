{
	["colorname"] = {
		readable_name, -- the untranslated "readable" name of the color to be used in descriptions
		groups, -- table of the color groups including legacy "unicolor"
		rgb, -- hex RGB value of the color
		unicolor, --the name of the color in the "unicolor" format
		mcl2, --this field is set in the cases where the colorname mismatches with the correspoinding mcl2 color. This was done to make color names more consistent and predictable.
	},
}
```
