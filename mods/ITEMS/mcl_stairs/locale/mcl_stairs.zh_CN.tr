Stairs are useful to reach higher places by walking over them; jumping is not required. Placing stairs in a corner pattern will create corner stairs. Stairs placed on the ceiling or at the upper half of the side of a block will be placed upside down.=楼梯可用于通过行走到达更高的地方，无需跳跃。将楼梯以角落样式摆放会形成转角楼梯。放置在天花板上或方块侧面上半部分的楼梯将会倒置放置。
Double @1=双层 @1
Slabs are half as high as their full block counterparts and occupy either the lower or upper part of a block, depending on how it was placed. Slabs can be easily stepped on without needing to jump. When a slab is placed on another slab of the same type, a double slab is created.=台阶的高度是与其对应的完整方块高度的一半，并且依据放置方式的不同，它会占据方块的下半部分或上半部分。可以轻松踏上台阶，无需跳跃。当一个台阶放置在另一个相同类型的台阶上时，就会形成一个双层台阶。
Upper @1=上部 @1
Double slabs are full blocks which are created by placing two slabs of the same kind on each other.=双层台阶是完整的方块，由将两个相同种类的台阶相互叠放而形成。
