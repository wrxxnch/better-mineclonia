msgid "A redstone torch is a redstone component which can be used to invert a redstone signal. It supplies its surrounding blocks with redstone power, except for the block it is attached to. A redstone torch is normally lit, but it can also be turned off by powering the block it is attached to. While unlit, a redstone torch does not power anything."
