It will be extinguished by nearby water and rain. Fire can be destroyed safely by punching it, but it is hurtful if you stand directly in it. If a fire is started above netherrack or a magma block, it will immediately turn into an eternal fire."
msgstr "火是一種具有傷害性和破壞性的方塊，但持續時間很短。它將破壞並向附近的易燃區塊蔓延，但當沒有什麼可燃燒的東西時，火就會消失。它將被附近的水和雨所熄滅。火可以通過打它來安全地摧毀，但如果你直接站在它裡面，它是有傷害的。如果火是在地獄石或岩漿塊上面點燃的，它將立即變成永恆的火。"

If a fire is started above netherrack or a magma block, it will immediately turn into an eternal fire."

msgid "Eternal fire is a damaging block that might create more fire. It will create fire around it when flammable blocks are nearby. Eternal fire can be extinguished by punches and nearby water blocks. Other than (normal) fire, eternal fire does not get extinguished on its own and also continues to burn under rain. Punching eternal fire is safe, but it hurts if you stand inside."
