Totem of Undying=不死圖騰
Protects you from death while wielding it=拿在手就能保你不死
A totem of undying is a rare artifact which may safe you from certain death.=不死圖騰是一種罕見的神器，有時能幫你跨過死門關。
The totem only works while you hold it in your hand. If you receive fatal damage, you are saved from death and you get a second chance with 1 HP. The totem is destroyed in the process, however.=
