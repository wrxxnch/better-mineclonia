An explosive device. When it explodes, it will hurt living beings and destroy blocks around it. TNT has an explosion power of @1. With a small chance, blocks may drop as an item (as if being mined) rather than being destroyed. TNT can be ignited by tools, explosions, fire, lava and redstone signals.=一种爆炸装置。爆炸时，它会伤害生物并摧毁周围的方块。三硝基甲苯的爆炸威力为 @1。小概率情况下，方块可能会作为物品掉落（就像被开采一样），而不是被摧毁。三硝基甲苯可以被工具、爆炸、火焰、熔岩和红石信号点燃。

TNT=三硝基甲苯（炸药）
Ignited by tools, explosions, fire, lava, redstone power=可由工具、爆炸、火焰、岩浆、红石能量来引燃
Explosion power: @1=爆炸强度：@1
Place the TNT and ignite it with one of the methods above. Quickly get in safe distance. The TNT will start to be affected by gravity and explodes in 4 seconds.=放置好三硝基甲苯，然后用上述方法之一将其引燃。迅速撤离到安全距离之外。三硝基甲苯将开始受重力影响，并在4秒后爆炸。
