msgid "Vehicle for fast travel on rails"
msgstr "使用鐵軌的高速載具"

msgid "Minecarts can be used for a quick transportion on rails."
msgstr "礦車是使用鐵軌的高速載具。"

msgid "Minecarts only ride on rails and always follow the tracks. At a T-junction with no straight way ahead, they turn left. The speed is affected by the rail type."
msgstr "礦車只能依循鐵軌行走，其速度受鐵軌類型影響。"

msgid "You can place the minecart on rails. Right-click it to enter it. Punch it to get it moving."
msgstr "拿著礦車對鐵軌使用以放置。再次使用以進入。進入後點擊礦車以前進。"

msgid "To obtain the minecart, punch it while holding down the sneak key."
msgstr "要取回礦車，在離開後潛行攻擊它就可以。"

msgid "If it moves over a powered activator rail, you'll get ejected."
msgstr "當礦車經過有能量的觸矛鐵軌，乘客會被彈出。"

msgid "Sneak to dismount"

msgid "Minecart with Furnace"
msgstr "熔爐礦車"

msgid "A minecart with furnace is a vehicle that travels on rails. It can propel itself with fuel."
msgstr "熔爐礦車是使用鐵軌的載具，消耗燃料就能自行前進。"

msgid "Place it on rails. If you give it some coal, the furnace will start burning for a long time and the minecart will be able to move itself. Punch it to get it moving."
msgstr "拿著礦車對鐵軌使用以放置。給它燃料，它就會啓動。攻擊礦車以發車。"

msgid "To obtain the minecart and furnace, punch them while holding down the sneak key."

msgid "Minecart with TNT"
msgstr "TNT礦車"

msgid "Can be ignited by tools or powered activator rail"
msgstr ""

msgid "A minecart with TNT is an explosive vehicle that travels on rail."
msgstr ""

msgid "Place it on rails. Punch it to move it. The TNT is ignited with a flint and steel or when the minecart is on an powered activator rail."
msgstr ""

msgid "To obtain the minecart and TNT, punch them while holding down the sneak key. You can't do this if the TNT was ignited."
msgstr ""

msgid "Place them on the ground to build your railway, the rails will automatically connect to each other and will turn into curves, T-junctions, crossings and slopes as needed."

msgid "Rail"
msgstr "鐵軌"

msgid "Track for minecarts"
msgstr "礦車用軌道"

msgid "Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. Normal rails slightly slow down minecarts due to friction."
msgstr ""

msgid "Powered Rail"
msgstr "動力鐵軌"

msgid "Speed up when powered, slow down when not powered"
