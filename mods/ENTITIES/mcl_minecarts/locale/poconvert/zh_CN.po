msgid "Minecart"
msgstr "矿车"

msgid "Vehicle for fast travel on rails"
msgstr "在铁轨上快速行驶的交通工具"

msgid "Minecarts can be used for a quick transportion on rails."
msgstr "矿车可用于在铁轨上快速运输。"

msgid "Minecarts only ride on rails and always follow the tracks. At a T-junction with no straight way ahead, they turn left. The speed is affected by the rail type."
msgstr "矿车只能在铁轨上行驶，并且始终沿着轨道行进。在前方没有直路的丁字路口处，它们会向左转弯。其速度受铁轨类型的影响。"

msgid "You can place the minecart on rails. Right-click it to enter it. Punch it to get it moving."
msgstr "你可以将矿车放置在铁轨上。右键点击它便可进入矿车。击打它就能让它动起来。"

msgid "To obtain the minecart, punch it while holding down the sneak key."
msgstr "若要获取矿车，在按住潜行键的同时击打即可。"

msgid "If it moves over a powered activator rail, you'll get ejected."
msgstr "如果它经过充能的激活铁轨，你就会被弹出。"

msgid "Sneak to dismount"
msgstr "潜行以离开"

msgid "Minecart with Chest"
msgstr "运输矿车"

msgid "Minecart with Furnace"
msgstr "动力矿车"

msgid "A minecart with furnace is a vehicle that travels on rails. It can propel itself with fuel."
msgstr "带熔炉的矿车是一种在铁轨上行驶的交通工具。它可以用燃料来驱动自身。"

msgid "Place it on rails. If you give it some coal, the furnace will start burning for a long time and the minecart will be able to move itself. Punch it to get it moving."
msgstr "将它放置在铁轨上。如果你给它添加一些煤炭，熔炉就会长时间燃烧，矿车就能自行移动了。击打它可以让它动起来。"

msgid "To obtain the minecart and furnace, punch them while holding down the sneak key."
msgstr "若要获取带熔炉的矿车，在按住潜行键的同时击打它即可。"

msgid "Minecart with Command Block"
msgstr "命令方块矿车"

msgid "Minecart with Hopper"
msgstr "漏斗矿车"

msgid "Place it on rails. Punch it to move it. The TNT is ignited with a flint and steel or when the minecart is on an powered activator rail."
msgstr "将它放置在铁轨上。击打它使其移动。可以用打火石和铁锭来点燃TNT，或者当矿车位于充能的激活铁轨上时，TNT也会被点燃。"

msgid "To obtain the minecart and TNT, punch them while holding down the sneak key. You can't do this if the TNT was ignited."
msgstr "若要获取装有TNT的矿车以及TNT，在按住潜行键的同时击打它们即可。但如果TNT已经被点燃了，就没办法这么做了。"

msgid "Place them on the ground to build your railway, the rails will automatically connect to each other and will turn into curves, T-junctions, crossings and slopes as needed."

msgid "Rail"
msgstr "铁轨"

msgid "Track for minecarts"
msgstr "矿车轨道"

msgid "Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. Normal rails slightly slow down minecarts due to friction."
msgstr "铁轨可用于为矿车建造运输轨道。普通铁轨由于存在摩擦力，会使矿车的速度稍有减慢。"
