Sneak-click to remove=跪著點擊以還原為物品
Minecart=礦車
Vehicle for fast travel on rails=使用鐵軌的高速載具
Minecarts can be used for a quick transportion on rails.=礦車是使用鐵軌的高速載具。
Minecarts only ride on rails and always follow the tracks. At a T-junction with no straight way ahead, they turn left. The speed is affected by the rail type.=礦車只能依循鐵軌行走，其速度受鐵軌類型影響。
You can place the minecart on rails. Right-click it to enter it. Punch it to get it moving.=拿著礦車對鐵軌使用以放置。再次使用以進入。進入後點擊礦車以前進。
To obtain the minecart, punch it while holding down the sneak key.=要取回礦車，在離開後潛行攻擊它就可以。
If it moves over a powered activator rail, you'll get ejected.=當礦車經過有能量的觸矛鐵軌，乘客會被彈出。
Sneak to dismount=潛行以離開
Minecart with Chest=儲物箱礦車
Minecart with Furnace=熔爐礦車
A minecart with furnace is a vehicle that travels on rails. It can propel itself with fuel.=熔爐礦車是使用鐵軌的載具，消耗燃料就能自行前進。
Place it on rails. If you give it some coal, the furnace will start burning for a long time and the minecart will be able to move itself. Punch it to get it moving.=拿著礦車對鐵軌使用以放置。給它燃料，它就會啓動。攻擊礦車以發車。
To obtain the minecart and furnace, punch them while holding down the sneak key.=要取回熔爐礦車，潛行攻擊它就可以。
Minecart with Command Block=指令方塊礦車
Minecart with Hopper=漏斗礦車
Minecart with TNT=TNT礦車
Can be ignited by tools or powered activator rail=
A minecart with TNT is an explosive vehicle that travels on rail.=
Place it on rails. Punch it to move it. The TNT is ignited with a flint and steel or when the minecart is on an powered activator rail.=
To obtain the minecart and TNT, punch them while holding down the sneak key. You can't do this if the TNT was ignited.=
Place them on the ground to build your railway, the rails will automatically connect to each other and will turn into curves, T-junctions, crossings and slopes as needed.=
Rail=鐵軌
Track for minecarts=礦車用軌道
Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. Normal rails slightly slow down minecarts due to friction.=
Powered Rail=動力鐵軌
Speed up when powered, slow down when not powered=
Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. Powered rails are able to accelerate and brake minecarts.=
Without redstone power, the rail will brake minecarts. To make this rail accelerate minecarts, power it with redstone power.=
Activator Rail=觸發鐵軌
Activates minecarts when powered=
Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. Activator rails are used to activate special minecarts.=
To make this rail activate minecarts, power it with redstone power and send a minecart over this piece of rail.=
Detector Rail=感壓鐵軌
Emits redstone power when a minecart is detected=在偵察到礦車時送出紅石能量
Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. A detector rail is able to detect a minecart above it and powers redstone mechanisms.=
To detect a minecart and provide redstone power, connect it to redstone trails or redstone mechanisms and send any minecart over the rail.=
